# Choucroute

Choucroute is a Web Application with the goal of simplifying personal recipes management.

It is intended to be compatible with the [Cooklang](https://cooklang.org) Recipe Markup language and is build with the goal of writing recipes with this language inside a Web editor.

This project is in WIP, and is currently under active development.
